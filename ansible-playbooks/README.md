# Nginx Setup with Ansible ðŸš€

This project contains my **first Ansible Playbook** that installs and starts **Nginx** on a target server.  
Itâ€™s a simple automation example to get hands-on with Ansible playbooks.  

---

## âœ… Prerequisites
- Ansible installed on **control node**
- At least **one worker node** accessible via SSH
- Passwordless SSH authentication set up between control & worker  
  (`ssh-keygen` + `ssh-copy-id` or AWS key pair)
